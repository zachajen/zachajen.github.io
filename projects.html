        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>Since I plan to go down the Data Analyst or Networking route with my degree, that means that I don't have many programming projects.</p>
        <p>However, I am working on a few! I will soon update this page and have the github links to them below, so keep an eye out for them!</p>
        <p>Until them, hopefully a description will sufice!</p>
        <h2>Python-Based Database Assistant</h2>
        <p>For anyone new to learning SQL, it might be intimidating to memorize the SQL terms and tools, especially if you're working in the shell of MySQL with no GUI.</p>
        <p>Luckily, this is the tool for you! Being a Python based user-input program, you tell it what you want to do, and it'll spit back out raw SQL for you to use!</p>
        <p>More than that, if you're just wanting to practice or brush up, it has a quiz mode, and it has a dummy data mode (which creates dummy data to fill spots in a practice database).</p>
        <p>Check it out at the link below!</p>
        <p>LINK HERE</p>
        <h2>Farming-RPG Game Engine</h2>
        <p>It would be the pentultimate project of my career to produce and publish my own Farming Simulator / RPG hybrid video game.</p>
        <p>And this is the start! For a project, I wanted to, from the ground up, build my own engine in C# (for compatability across platforms).</p>
        <p>Check it out while it's in progress below!</p>
