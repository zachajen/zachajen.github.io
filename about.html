        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hey there! Thank you for wanting to learn more about me! While this website is pretty tucked away, there is certain info I'm not comfortable sharing completely publicly.</p>
        <p>Don't fret! There's still lots of information below, and if you want to know more, my Contact tab has ways to get in communication! Please check it out! Thank you!</p>
        <h2>School</h2>
        <p>I attend Friends University, and am a Computer Science Major, with an emphasis in Cyber Security, and a Minor in Mathematics.</p>
        <p>I'm involved in music ensembles, the New Student Orientation Team, and Student Government!</p>
        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>I have expierence working programming, mostly in Java and Python. My preferred language is Java, but I'm a quick learner!</p>
        <p>I also have experience with database tools, such as Access, MySQL, and most recently PowerBI. As a student worker, I have been working with PowerBI, so my skills there have grown!</p>
        <p>Just about anything pertaining to computers I have done at least once, and I pick it all up very quickly!</p>
        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>I pride myself on five things: 1.) Quality work, 2.) Getting stuff done on time, 3.) Working well with others, 4.) Being an effective communicator, 5.) Thinking on my feet.</p>
        <p>While all of those are general skills, they are ones I am proud of. When I do something, it gets done on time, and it is done well. I take pride in what I do and how I do it.</p>
        <p>More than that, I also work well in teams. I have lots of experience doing so on campus, both as a team-member and a team-leader. This, paired with my ability to talk, explain, and even persuade, makes me proud of my social abilities.</p>
        <p>Finally, I think incredibly quickly on my feet (a career of debate and forensics will do that to you)! That makes me a key memeber of many groups, as I can take roll with the punches, and still get things done and done well!</p>
